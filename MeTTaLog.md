# MeTTaLog: An Implementation of MeTTa for Logic Programming

## Overview

MeTTaLog is a novel logic programming framework inspired by OpenCog Hyperon's MeTTa (Meta Type Talk) language. This project aims to provide a rich set of features, including meta-language capabilities, various types of inference, and clear semantics. MeTTaLog is designed to serve as a practical tool for both research and applications in artificial intelligence, semantic web, natural language processing, and beyond.

## Introduction

MeTTaLog is a language designed to be a successor to OpenCog Classic Atomese. It forms part of the OpenCog Hyperon initiative, with clear semantics supporting meta-language features, different types of inference, and more.

## Prerequisites

- SWI-Prolog
- Python 3.x

## Installation

### Installing Required SWI-Prolog Packs

Before you install MeTTaLog, open your SWI-Prolog terminal and install the Janus Python Bridge and logimcoo_utils packs:

```prolog
?- pack_install('logicmoo_utils').

?- pack_install('logicmoo_utils').
```

### Main Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/logicmoo/metta-vspace.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd MeTTaLog

# Install dependencies
make install

# Build the project
make build
```

To start the first unit test, run:

```bash
./Metta examples/compat/test_scripts/00_lang_case.metta
```
